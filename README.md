## Work and Hobbies

I am a self-taught software developer with a deep passion for programming and problem-solving. My journey began with Java 7 SE, where I created various applets and programs, eventually leading me to robotics programming as the lead programmer for FRC teams [7658](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/7658) and [6002](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/6002). I also competed in the [SquareOne Education Network Autonomous Innovative Vehicle Design Challenge](https://www.squareonenetwork.org/) for three years, where I had hands-on experience utilizing hobby electronics and microcontrollers programming autonomous cars in C/C++ for competitions. During the latter part of my time competing in SquareOne, I began to developed a web interface to manage hardware and issue commands to the microcontrollers, which is what initially sparked my interest in JavaScript and Node.js. However quickly this led me to discover Rust in 2019, a language I have since fallen in love with. I’ve migrated most of my SaaS codebase from Java and Node.js to Rust, finding it to be a more powerful and efficient tool for my needs.

In addition to programming, I’ve been working in IT since 2019, covering a wide range of roles from LAN Technician to Systems Analyst. Over the years, I’ve developed strong skills in Mobile Device Management (MDM) and thoroughly enjoy the daily interactions and challenges that come with this line of work. The variety of tasks keeps me engaged, whether it’s managing infrastructure or troubleshooting user issues.

Running my [own website](https://unorthodoxdev.net/) and staying active with personal programming projects allow me to continuously sharpen my skills and stay on top of industry trends. I find these activities not only rewarding but also essential for staying current in a fast-paced field like IT.

More recently, I’ve been diving into the cybersecurity space, exploring new areas and expanding my knowledge in that direction. Cybersecurity feels like a natural extension of my IT and programming skills, and it’s an exciting challenge that I’m eager to pursue further.

At the moment, my top priority is finishing my education and obtaining more certifications to enhance my skill set. With school taking center stage, I’m committed to growing both academically and professionally to open up new career opportunities in the future.

Some certificates I am aiming for are as follows:
